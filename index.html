        <p> Week 1: 8/21-8/25 - Hello everbody! This is a webiste for my Intro to Engineering class. I will be talking about what I learn and showing you any projects that I make. Today I am making my first journal entry. Before today, we've spent the majority of class time setting up our websites and learning how to code the website. We are making our websites through AWS and GitHub. It was fairly easy to make our websites and it was a cool process. Friday is going to normally be our "challenge day" so today, as our first challenge, the class was split up into two teams. Each team competed to be the first to get a marble into a bucket using about eight pipes. Everybody had to touch a pipe and you couldn't overlap pipes. My half of the class lost, as we came up with a plan without everyone communicating their ideas and stuck with it the whole time when it was obvious it was not working. The other half of the class took awhile to come up with a fullproof plan. They all worked really well together and modified as they saw necessary. Beause of this experience, I learned about the importance of taking your time to come up with a plan and considering everyone's ideas. It is sometimes better to take it slow, because in the long run you will get to your goal faster. We also spent today talking about safety and how to properly use materials so we don't waste them.  </p>
       
        <p> Week 2: 8/28-9/07 - During this time, we have mostly been working on our project for the mechanical engineering unit. After we took our safety quiz, we went over what mechanical engineering was and we took a quiz on that. I learned the many possiblilities of mechanical engineering and many cool mechanical engineering projects, like the Austin Project. For our project, we have to create a Rube Goldberg machine that starts with a baseball and ends with popping a balloon with a needle. My group collaberated to come up with the design we wanted to do, and then we had to CAD it on Tinkercad. We practiced CADing on the 30th, making a home appliance on Tinkercad. Below is an image of my CAD. I made an oven, although we did not have a lot of time so I was not able to add most of the details I wanted to. Below is also a few pitures of our finished Rube Goldberg CAD.<p/>

        <p> Week 3: 9/08-9/18 - On the 8th, we started building the Rube Goldberg Machine. We measured and cut our elements out of cardboad and taped some of the pieces together. We have had to make some modifications to our design to help with stability and solve some probelms that came up. We finished our Rube Goldberg Machine on Monday the 18th and took a video of it working. There is a link to the video below along with pictures of the final product and the process of making the Rube Goldberg Machine. There were many problems we had to fix along the way and, although frustrating, seeing it finally work was really rewarding. We determined, to save materials and space, that we didn't need the lever to be standing on a box. So, we did not make a box and, instead, shortened the sides of the overhead cardboard piece and taped the lever to the base. Originally, we wanted to use a counter weight for the pulley and just let go of it to let the baseball down. However, the baseball was hitting the lever too hard and fast, causing the car to flip over instead of rolling down the ramp. We added more weight, but then the baseball wasn't heavy enough to pull it. We tried many different weights and even tried wrapping the string around a pencil so it would unravel. However, we just ended up tieing an eraser to the string and flinging the eraser to release the tension on the string and let the baseball down. We did some tests without the balloon and determined it would work. Then, we got the balloon and recorded our machine in action.</p>

        <p> Week 4: 9/19-9/29 - We have spent thiss time learning about Computer Engineering. We went through slides explaining what Computer Engineering is all about. Then, we did our computer dissection lab. It was fairly quick to take all the picees out, but putting them back in took a little longer. We were able to identify the disk drive, fan, motherboard, and RAM. We payed careful attention to which screws went where, although remembering was a bit diffiult. There are a few pictures of the dissection process below along with a few pictures of a worksheet we did after on the parts of a laptop.</p>

        <p> Week 5: 10/02-10/06 - After finishing our Computer Engineering unit, we moved on the Bioengineering. We had to make a prosthetic hand that could pick up an empty, plastic water bottle. We worked in groups of two or three, working on the hand for almost an entire period. Me and my partner originally cut out an oversized hand from carboard and tried to start barinstorming. We had the fingers spread out, but determined it would be better to have them all line up. So, we used the first cutout as a test subject. We tried threading the string through holes in the fingers, but we couldn't get it to fold right. We taped the string to the tip of the finger and tried to figure out how to secure the rest of the tape along the finger. We knew that tapeing the string down would probably not work as when we pulled the string it would just break the cardboard. We decided on taping the string down, but putting a smaller piece of tape over part of the sticky part where the string would rest. So, the string had something to slide on so when we pulled the string it would bunch up and bend the finger. We cut slits in the fingers to make them bend better and taped the middle and ring finger together, as we had originally made them too thin. We made individual strings for each finger and taped them together at the bottom. We tested it out, but it was awkward to just hold the had. So we added a cardboard arm and it ended up being able to pick up the water bottle. There are pictures of our design and a video of it working below.</p>

        <p> Week 6: 10/09-10/20 - During this time, we have been doing our Aerospace Engineering unit. We learned what Aerospace Engineering was and learned about the four forces on airplanes and rockets. We used this knowledge on weight, thrust, lift, and drag for our project. We had to create a 2-liter bottle rocket that would be powered by water and air pressure. We did a CAD of our design and then got to building. We attached a pencil to the side of the bottle to slide into the "rails" on the launchpad that would guide the rocket. Below is a picture of our CAD, our finished design, and a video of our rocket in action. Our rocket spun around in a circle while in the air, as did many other projects. I think the weight was not distributed correctly. For our project, we originally made the four fins touching the ground so the rocket could stand up by itself. We realized the neck of the bottle could no longer fit into the launchpad, so we had to cut down the fins. We put a paper cone on the end of the bottle and put a paper ball inside the cone so it would be more stable. We used paper instead of cardboard as we thought cardboard would make the front too heavy. </p>
