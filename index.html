        <p> Week 1: 8/21-8/25 - Hello everybody! This is a website for my Intro to Engineering class. I will be talking about what I learn and showing you any projects that I make. Today I am making my first journal entry. Before today, we've spent the majority of class time setting up our websites and learning how to code the website. We are making our websites through AWS and GitHub. It was fairly easy to make our websites and it was a cool process. Friday is going to normally be our "challenge day" so today, as our first challenge, the class was split up into two teams. Each team competed to be the first to get a marble into a bucket using about eight pipes. Everybody had to touch a pipe and you couldn't overlap pipes. My half of the class lost, as we came up with a plan without everyone communicating their ideas and stuck with it the whole time when it was obvious it was not working. The other half of the class took awhile to come up with a foolproof plan. They all worked really well together and modified as they saw necessary. Because of this experience, I learned about the importance of taking your time to come up with a plan and considering everyone's ideas. It is sometimes better to take it slow, because in the long run you will get to your goal faster. We also spent today talking about safety and how to properly use materials so we don't waste them.  </p>

        <p> Week 2: 8/28-9/07 - During this time, we have mostly been working on our project for the mechanical engineering unit. After we took our safety quiz, we went over what mechanical engineering was and we took a quiz on that. I learned the many possibilities of mechanical engineering and many cool mechanical engineering projects, like the Austin Project. For our project, we have to create a Rube Goldberg machine that starts with a baseball and ends with popping a balloon with a needle. My group collaborated to come up with the design we wanted to do, and then we had to CAD it on Tinkercad. We practiced CADing on the 30th, making a home appliance on Tinkercad. Below is an image of my CAD. I made an oven, although we did not have a lot of time so I was not able to add most of the details I wanted to. Below are also a few pictures of our finished Rube Goldberg CAD.<p/>

        <p> Week 3: 9/08-9/18 - On the 8th, we started building the Rube Goldberg Machine. We measured and cut our elements out of cardboard and taped some of the pieces together. We have had to make some modifications to our design to help with stability and solve some problems that came up. We finished our Rube Goldberg Machine on Monday the 18th and took a video of it working. There is a link to the video below along with pictures of the final product and the process of making the Rube Goldberg Machine. There were many problems we had to fix along the way and, although frustrating, seeing it finally work was really rewarding. We determined, to save materials and space, that we didn't need the lever to be standing on a box. So, we did not make a box and, instead, shortened the sides of the overhead cardboard piece and taped the lever to the base. Originally, we wanted to use a counter weight for the pulley and just let go of it to let the baseball down. However, the baseball was hitting the lever too hard and fast, causing the car to flip over instead of rolling down the ramp. We added more weight, but then the baseball wasn't heavy enough to pull it. We tried many different weights and even tried wrapping the string around a pencil so it would unravel. However, we just ended up tying an eraser to the string and flinging the eraser to release the tension on the string and let the baseball down. We did some tests without the balloon and determined it would work. Then, we got the balloon and recorded our machine in action.</p>

        <p> Week 4: 9/19-9/29 - We have spent this time learning about Computer Engineering. We went through slides explaining what Computer Engineering is all about. Then, we did our computer dissection lab. It was fairly quick to take all the pieces out, but putting them back in took a little longer. We were able to identify the disk drive, fan, motherboard, and RAM. We paid careful attention to which screws went where, although remembering was a bit difficult. There are a few pictures of the dissection process below along with a few pictures of a worksheet we did after on the parts of a laptop.</p>

        <p> Week 5: 10/02-10/06 - After finishing our Computer Engineering unit, we moved on to Bioengineering. We had to make a prosthetic hand that could pick up an empty, plastic water bottle. We worked in groups of two or three, working on the hand for almost an entire period. Me and my partner originally cut out an oversized hand from cardboard and tried to start brainstorming. We had the fingers spread out, but determined it would be better to have them all line up. So, we used the first cutout as a test subject. We tried threading the string through holes in the fingers, but we couldn't get it to fold right. We taped the string to the tip of the finger and tried to figure out how to secure the rest of the tape along the finger. We knew that taping the string down would probably not work as when we pulled the string it would just break the cardboard. We decided on taping the string down, but putting a smaller piece of tape over part of the sticky part where the string would rest. So, the string had something to slide on so when we pulled the string it would bunch up and bend the finger. We cut slits in the fingers to make them bend better and taped the middle and ring finger together, as we had originally made them too thin. We made individual strings for each finger and taped them together at the bottom. We tested it out, but it was awkward to just hold the had. So we added a cardboard arm and it ended up being able to pick up the water bottle. There are pictures of our design and a video of it working below.</p>

        <p> Week 6: 10/09-10/20 - During this time, we have been doing our Aerospace Engineering unit. We learned what Aerospace Engineering was and learned about the four forces on airplanes and rockets. We used this knowledge on weight, thrust, lift, and drag for our project. We had to create a 2-liter bottle rocket that would be powered by water and air pressure. We did a CAD of our design and then got to building. We attached a pencil to the side of the bottle to slide into the "rails" on the launchpad that would guide the rocket. Below is a picture of our CAD, our finished design, and a video of our rocket in action. Our rocket spun around in a circle while in the air, as did many other projects. I think the weight was not distributed correctly. For our project, we originally made the four fins touching the ground so the rocket could stand up by itself. We realized the neck of the bottle could no longer fit into the launchpad, so we had to cut down the fins. We put a paper cone on the end of the bottle and put a paper ball inside the cone so it would be more stable. We used paper instead of cardboard as we thought cardboard would make the front too heavy. </p>

        <p> Week 7: 10/23-10/27 - This week, we have been doing our environmental engineering unit. We learned about what it was and some of the many different aspects and applications of it, one of these being water filtration. So, for our project we worked in groups of two to make a water filter out of cotton balls, sand, small rocks, and big rocks. We chose a half of a bottle and got to building from the bottom up. First, we put about 10 cotton balls. Then, we put a thick layer of sand and rocks (small and large). We tested it and it filtered the water quite a bit, it just had a yellow color. So, we decided to add a thicker layer of sand. The result was more clear water. Although, it still had a yellow hue. There is a video of our devicce filtering the water (second model) and a picture of our design (first model).</p>

        <p> Week 8: 10/27-11/3 - During this time, we have been working on Electrical Engineering. We learned about what it was and went over voltage, current, resistance, and power. We also learned about grounds and AC vs. DC. We went over Ohm's Law and did a simple worksheet using the equation to find voltage, current, and resistance. We overviewed parallel and series circuits and the difference between them. We used this information to complete two labs, creating circuits on TinkerCAD. Attached below is a screenshot of the second lab. For the second lab we had to make a parallel circuit and a series circuit each on different breadboards that would each light up three LEDs. At first, going through the first lab I was very confused. Electrical Engineering was new to me and I was a little confused on the circuits. After finishing lab 1, and not even being sure if I did everything correctly, I moved onto lab 2. Lab 2 was a little harder and required more of an understanding of the material. Struggling through lab 2 helped me make some connections and gain a better understanding of the basics behind circuits. For lab 2, after I completed the parallel circuit and finally understood the basics, making the series circuit was really simple. I think it was good that I struggled, as it helped me fully absorb the information and make connections that helped me understand what I was doing instead of just doing what I was being told to do without understanding why.</p>

        <p> Week 9: 11/06-11/10 - We have been continuing with our Electrical Engineering unit, but now working hands on. Each group of two got a breadboard, three LEDs, multiple wires, three resistors, an arduino to use as a power source, and a multimeter to test the voltage and resistance at different parts in the circuit. There were 4 labs for us to complete, two of which were a repeat of the labs we did on TinkerCAD. Lab 4 had multiple parts, where we had to code the arduino to get the LED to blink. There was getting one LED to blink, getting 3 LEDs to blink, two sequences of blinking, and one where we were just trying to get the LED to fade in and out. Attached below are a few videos of some of the labs. Figuring out how to set up the coding platform for the Arduino was a bit difficult, but eventually we got it working, although figuring out the code turned out to be pretty simple. When working with the breadboard we were sometimes confused as to why our circuit wasn't working and had to make sure everything was lined up properly. Also, it was a bit difficult to tell the positive side of the LED from the negative side, since each side was bent and kind of mangled, but switching them around wasn't that big of a problem. </p>

        <p> Week 10: 11/13-12/01 - We have been working on a new unit, business engineering. We went over the slides learning all about business engineering. We learned about things like sprints, marketing (UX and UI), Kanban boards, copyright, intellectual property, the waterfall method, and project management. For our project, we had to create a presentation for an invention. Me and my partner Amanda made a google slides presentation on heated slippers. Although heated slippers are already on the market, there wasn't a design that we felt hit all the marks. So, we made our own design. We used SWOT to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with our design. Below are a few pictures of our slide presentation.</p>

        <p>Spaghetti Bridge Analysis - Civil Engineering
        
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Our first, test iteration of the spaghetti bridge weighted 30.9 grams. The second, final iteration weighted 29.6 grams.</li>
          <li>Our first design was able to hold about 525.3 grams of water. Our final iteration of the spaghetti bridge held 1263 grams of water. </li>
          <li>Our first design got a score of about 17 (dividing the water held by the bridge weight). However, our final design got a score of 42.6, earning it second place of 10 groups, behind group 7 with a score of 44.4.</li>
          <li>The ends of our bridge ended up being the heaviest parts, although we did cut down on the amount of glue from our first test. This is due to the fact that we put barely any glue on the middle of the bridge, hoping to allow for more flexibility. However, the ends had most of the glue making them the heaviest because the glue contributed to most of the weight.</li>
          <li>The inspiration for our design came from researching types of bridges and what made them able to support a heavy load. We learned that crisscrossing, triangles, tight features, and some flexibility would be beneficial. So, we tried to limit glue and use triangle and crisscross supports only towards the ends of the bridge to allow for lots of flexibility in the center while still providing support. We also made our bridge with 2 layers of spaghetti that were tightly packed together, allowing for additional support.</li>
          <li>The design worked better than expected, as, during the design process there were multiple breaks in the bridge that we had to repair. One of these end breaks even resulted in the end to be curved up instead of straight. We expected it to snap in the middle, where one of the breaks was, but our repair job and the flexibility of the middle of the bridge made it survive much longer.</li>
          <li>The bridge snapped at the ends both times. I estimated the point of failure to be where the bridge broke during the design process on the ends of the bridge.</li>
          <li>A little less glue on the ends of the bridge could allow for more flexibility. This change could have potentially prolonged the snapping at the ends of the bridge. Also, if the design process had gone smoother so that there weren't breaks in the bridge it may have been, overall, stronger.</li>

        <p>01/10-01/12 - These couple of days we have been learning about Chemical Engineering. We went over the many, many possible fields of Chemical Engineering. Unfortunately, we are fairly limited in projects that would be safe and that we would have enough materials for. So, we made oobleck. Oobleck is a non-newtonian fluid. It can be either solid or liquid, depending on how much pressure is applied. It can be made of cornstarch and water. However, we were not told the ratio we would have to use in order to properly make the substance. So, we assumed there would be more cornstarch than water, so we added water little by little to a few scoops of cornstarch until we got the right consistency. There are images and videos below. </p>

        <p>After taking our chemical engineering quiz, we have moved onto our long term projects. For this project, we had to choose between a car propelled by a mousetrap and an arduino car. We decided to go with the arduino car since we as a group have a decent amount of coding experience so we thought it would be fun to do. First, we had to do a project proposal in which we described our project, explained the research we had conducted, figured out the constraints of our design, made a BOM, and made a schedule for our milestones. Then we measured, sketched, and CADed our design. We also made an online circuit to experiment in how we would make our connections. Pictures are below. For the sketch, one box represents 1 cm.</p>
