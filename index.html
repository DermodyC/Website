        <p> Week 1: 8/21-8/25 - Hello everbody! This is a webiste for my Intro to Engineering class. I will be talking about what I learn and showing you any projects that I make. Today I am making my first journal entry. Before today, we've spent the majority of class time setting up our websites and learning how to code the website. We are making our websites through AWS and GitHub. It was fairly easy to make our websites and it was a cool process. Friday is going to normally be our "challenge day" so today, as our first challenge, the class was split up into two teams. Each team competed to be the first to get a marble into a bucket using about eight pipes. Everybody had to touch a pipe and you couldn't overlap pipes. My half of the class lost, as we came up with a plan without everyone communicating their ideas and stuck with it the whole time when it was obvious it was not working. The other half of the class took awhile to come up with a fullproof plan. They all worked really well together and modified as they saw necessary. Beause of this experience, I learned about the importance of taking your time to come up with a plan and considering everyone's ideas. It is sometimes better to take it slow, because in the long run you will get to your goal faster. We also spent today talking about safety and how to properly use materials so we don't waste them.  </p>
        
        <p> Week 2: 8/26-9/11 - During this time, we have mostly been working on our project for the mehanical engineering unit. We have to create a Rube Goldberg machine that starts with a baseball and ends with popping a balloon with a needle. My group collaberated to come up with the design we wanted to do, and then we had to CAD it on Tinkercad. Above is a few pitures of our finished CAD. On friday of last week, my group started the actual building proess. So far, we have measured and ut out a few of our elements out of cardboad. </p>
