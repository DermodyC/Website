        <p> Week 1: 8/21-8/25 - Hello everbody! This is a webiste for my Intro to Engineering class. I will be talking about what I learn and showing you any projects that I make. Today I am making my first journal entry. Before today, we've spent the majority of class time setting up our websites and learning how to code the website. We are making our websites through AWS and GitHub. It was fairly easy to make our websites and it was a cool process. Friday is going to normally be our "challenge day" so today, as our first challenge, the class was split up into two teams. Each team competed to be the first to get a marble into a bucket using about eight pipes. Everybody had to touch a pipe and you couldn't overlap pipes. My half of the class lost, as we came up with a plan without everyone communicating their ideas and stuck with it the whole time when it was obvious it was not working. The other half of the class took awhile to come up with a fullproof plan. They all worked really well together and modified as they saw necessary. Beause of this experience, I learned about the importance of taking your time to come up with a plan and considering everyone's ideas. It is sometimes better to take it slow, because in the long run you will get to your goal faster. We also spent today talking about safety and how to properly use materials so we don't waste them.  </p>
       
        <p> Week 2 + 3: 8/28-9/11 - During this time, we have mostly been working on our project for the mechanical engineering unit. After we took our safety quiz, we went over what mechanical engineering was and we took a quiz on that. I learned the many possiblilities of mechanical engineering and many cool mechanical engineering projects, like the Austin Project. For our project, we have to create a Rube Goldberg machine that starts with a baseball and ends with popping a balloon with a needle. My group collaberated to come up with the design we wanted to do, and then we had to CAD it on Tinkercad. We practiced CADing on the 30th, making a home appliance on Tinkercad. Below is an image of my CAD. I made an oven, although we did not have a lot of time so I was not able to add most of the details I wanted to. Below is also a few pitures of our finished Rube Goldberg CAD. On the 8th, my group started the actual building process. So far, we have measured and cut out a few of our elements out of cardboad. We have also started to tape some of the pieces together. We have had to make some modifications to our design to help with stability and solve some probelms that came up. So far, it is coming together really well.</p>

        <p> Week 4: 9/12-9/18 - We finished our Rube Goldberg Machine! We finished it on Monday the 18th and took a video of it working. There is a link to the video below along with pictures of the final product and the process of making the Rube Goldberg Machine. There were many problems we had to fix along the way and, although frustrating, seeing it finally work was really rewarding. We cut out and taped more of the pieces, creating the ramp and the lever. We determined, to save materials and space, that we didn't need the lever to be standing on a box. So, we did not make a box and, instead, shortened the sides of the overhead cardboard piece and taped the lever to the base. Originally, we wanted to use a counter weight for the pulley and just let go of it to let the baseball down. However, the baseball was hitting the lever too hard and fast, causing the car to flip over instead of rolling down the ramp. We added more weight, but then the baseball wasn't heavy enough to pull it. We tried many different weights and even tried wrapping the string around a pencil so it would unravel. However, we just ended up tieing an eraser to the string and flinging the eraser to release the tension on the string and let the baseball down. We did some tests without the balloon and determined it would work. Then, we got the balloon and recorded our machine in action.</p>
