        <p> Week 1: 8/21-8/25 - Hello everybody! This is a website for my Intro to Engineering class. I will be talking about what I learn and showing you any projects that I make. Today I am making my first journal entry. Before today, we've spent the majority of class time setting up our websites and learning how to code the website. We are making our websites through AWS and GitHub. It was fairly easy to make our websites and it was a cool process. Friday is going to normally be our "challenge day" so today, as our first challenge, the class was split up into two teams. Each team competed to be the first to get a marble into a bucket using about eight pipes. Everybody had to touch a pipe and you couldn't overlap pipes. My half of the class lost, as we came up with a plan without everyone communicating their ideas and stuck with it the whole time when it was obvious it was not working. The other half of the class took awhile to come up with a foolproof plan. They all worked really well together and modified as they saw necessary. Because of this experience, I learned about the importance of taking your time to come up with a plan and considering everyone's ideas. It is sometimes better to take it slow, because in the long run you will get to your goal faster. We also spent today talking about safety and how to properly use materials so we don't waste them.  </p>

        <p> Week 2: 8/28-9/07 - During this time, we have mostly been working on our project for the mechanical engineering unit. After we took our safety quiz, we went over what mechanical engineering was and we took a quiz on that. I learned the many possibilities of mechanical engineering and many cool mechanical engineering projects, like the Austin Project. For our project, we have to create a Rube Goldberg machine that starts with a baseball and ends with popping a balloon with a needle. My group collaborated to come up with the design we wanted to do, and then we had to CAD it on Tinkercad. We practiced CADing on the 30th, making a home appliance on Tinkercad. Below is an image of my CAD. I made an oven, although we did not have a lot of time so I was not able to add most of the details I wanted to. Below are also a few pictures of our finished Rube Goldberg CAD.<p/>

        <p> Week 3: 9/08-9/18 - On the 8th, we started building the Rube Goldberg Machine. We measured and cut our elements out of cardboard and taped some of the pieces together. We have had to make some modifications to our design to help with stability and solve some problems that came up. We finished our Rube Goldberg Machine on Monday the 18th and took a video of it working. There is a link to the video below along with pictures of the final product and the process of making the Rube Goldberg Machine. There were many problems we had to fix along the way and, although frustrating, seeing it finally work was really rewarding. We determined, to save materials and space, that we didn't need the lever to be standing on a box. So, we did not make a box and, instead, shortened the sides of the overhead cardboard piece and taped the lever to the base. Originally, we wanted to use a counter weight for the pulley and just let go of it to let the baseball down. However, the baseball was hitting the lever too hard and fast, causing the car to flip over instead of rolling down the ramp. We added more weight, but then the baseball wasn't heavy enough to pull it. We tried many different weights and even tried wrapping the string around a pencil so it would unravel. However, we just ended up tying an eraser to the string and flinging the eraser to release the tension on the string and let the baseball down. We did some tests without the balloon and determined it would work. Then, we got the balloon and recorded our machine in action.</p>

        <p> Week 4: 9/19-9/29 - We have spent this time learning about Computer Engineering. We went through slides explaining what Computer Engineering is all about. Then, we did our computer dissection lab. It was fairly quick to take all the pieces out, but putting them back in took a little longer. We were able to identify the disk drive, fan, motherboard, and RAM. We paid careful attention to which screws went where, although remembering was a bit difficult. There are a few pictures of the dissection process below along with a few pictures of a worksheet we did after on the parts of a laptop.</p>

        <p> Week 5: 10/02-10/06 - After finishing our Computer Engineering unit, we moved on to Bioengineering. We had to make a prosthetic hand that could pick up an empty, plastic water bottle. We worked in groups of two or three, working on the hand for almost an entire period. Me and my partner originally cut out an oversized hand from cardboard and tried to start brainstorming. We had the fingers spread out, but determined it would be better to have them all line up. So, we used the first cutout as a test subject. We tried threading the string through holes in the fingers, but we couldn't get it to fold right. We taped the string to the tip of the finger and tried to figure out how to secure the rest of the tape along the finger. We knew that taping the string down would probably not work as when we pulled the string it would just break the cardboard. We decided on taping the string down, but putting a smaller piece of tape over part of the sticky part where the string would rest. So, the string had something to slide on so when we pulled the string it would bunch up and bend the finger. We cut slits in the fingers to make them bend better and taped the middle and ring finger together, as we had originally made them too thin. We made individual strings for each finger and taped them together at the bottom. We tested it out, but it was awkward to just hold the had. So we added a cardboard arm and it ended up being able to pick up the water bottle. There are pictures of our design and a video of it working below.</p>

        <p> Week 6: 10/09-10/20 - During this time, we have been doing our Aerospace Engineering unit. We learned what Aerospace Engineering was and learned about the four forces on airplanes and rockets. We used this knowledge on weight, thrust, lift, and drag for our project. We had to create a 2-liter bottle rocket that would be powered by water and air pressure. We did a CAD of our design and then got to building. We attached a pencil to the side of the bottle to slide into the "rails" on the launchpad that would guide the rocket. Below is a picture of our CAD, our finished design, and a video of our rocket in action. Our rocket spun around in a circle while in the air, as did many other projects. I think the weight was not distributed correctly. For our project, we originally made the four fins touching the ground so the rocket could stand up by itself. We realized the neck of the bottle could no longer fit into the launchpad, so we had to cut down the fins. We put a paper cone on the end of the bottle and put a paper ball inside the cone so it would be more stable. We used paper instead of cardboard as we thought cardboard would make the front too heavy. </p>

        <p> Week 7: 10/23-10/27 - This week, we have been doing our environmental engineering unit. We learned about what it was and some of the many different aspects and applications of it, one of these being water filtration. So, for our project we worked in groups of two to make a water filter out of cotton balls, sand, small rocks, and big rocks. We chose a half of a bottle and got to building from the bottom up. First, we put about 10 cotton balls. Then, we put a thick layer of sand and rocks (small and large). We tested it and it filtered the water quite a bit, it just had a yellow color. So, we decided to add a thicker layer of sand. The result was more clear water. Although, it still had a yellow hue. There is a video of our devicce filtering the water (second model) and a picture of our design (first model).</p>

        <p> Week 8: 10/27-11/3 - During this time, we have been working on Electrical Engineering. We learned about what it was and went over voltage, current, resistance, and power. We also learned about grounds and AC vs. DC. We went over Ohm's Law and did a simple worksheet using the equation to find voltage, current, and resistance. We overviewed parallel and series circuits and the difference between them. We used this information to complete two labs, creating circuits on TinkerCAD. Attached below is a screenshot of the second lab. For the second lab we had to make a parallel circuit and a series circuit each on different breadboards that would each light up three LEDs. At first, going through the first lab I was very confused. Electrical Engineering was new to me and I was a little confused on the circuits. After finishing lab 1, and not even being sure if I did everything correctly, I moved onto lab 2. Lab 2 was a little harder and required more of an understanding of the material. Struggling through lab 2 helped me make some connections and gain a better understanding of the basics behind circuits. For lab 2, after I completed the parallel circuit and finally understood the basics, making the series circuit was really simple. I think it was good that I struggled, as it helped me fully absorb the information and make connections that helped me understand what I was doing instead of just doing what I was being told to do without understanding why.</p>

        <p> Week 9: 11/06-11/10 - We have been continuing with our Electrical Engineering unit, but now working hands on. Each group of two got a breadboard, three LEDs, multiple wires, three resistors, an arduino to use as a power source, and a multimeter to test the voltage and resistance at different parts in the circuit. There were 4 labs for us to complete, two of which were a repeat of the labs we did on TinkerCAD. Lab 4 had multiple parts, where we had to code the arduino to get the LED to blink. There was getting one LED to blink, getting 3 LEDs to blink, two sequences of blinking, and one where we were just trying to get the LED to fade in and out. Attached below are a few videos of some of the labs. Figuring out how to set up the coding platform for the Arduino was a bit difficult, but eventually we got it working, although figuring out the code turned out to be pretty simple. When working with the breadboard we were sometimes confused as to why our circuit wasn't working and had to make sure everything was lined up properly. Also, it was a bit difficult to tell the positive side of the LED from the negative side, since each side was bent and kind of mangled, but switching them around wasn't that big of a problem. </p>

        <p> Week 10: 11/13-12/01 - We have been working on a new unit, business engineering. We went over the slides learning all about business engineering. We learned about things like sprints, marketing (UX and UI), Kanban boards, copyright, intellectual property, the waterfall method, and project management. For our project, we had to create a presentation for an invention. Me and my partner Amanda made a google slides presentation on heated slippers. Although heated slippers are already on the market, there wasn't a design that we felt hit all the marks. So, we made our own design. We used SWOT to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with our design. Below are a few pictures of our slide presentation.</p>

        <p>Spaghetti Bridge Analysis - Civil Engineering
        
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Our first, test iteration of the spaghetti bridge weighted 30.9 grams. The second, final iteration weighted 29.6 grams.</li>
          <li>Our first design was able to hold about 525.3 grams of water. Our final iteration of the spaghetti bridge held 1263 grams of water. </li>
          <li>Our first design got a score of about 17 (dividing the water held by the bridge weight). However, our final design got a score of 42.6, earning it second place of 10 groups, behind group 7 with a score of 44.4.</li>
          <li>The ends of our bridge ended up being the heaviest parts, although we did cut down on the amount of glue from our first test. This is due to the fact that we put barely any glue on the middle of the bridge, hoping to allow for more flexibility. However, the ends had most of the glue making them the heaviest because the glue contributed to most of the weight.</li>
          <li>The inspiration for our design came from researching types of bridges and what made them able to support a heavy load. We learned that crisscrossing, triangles, tight features, and some flexibility would be beneficial. So, we tried to limit glue and use triangle and crisscross supports only towards the ends of the bridge to allow for lots of flexibility in the center while still providing support. We also made our bridge with 2 layers of spaghetti that were tightly packed together, allowing for additional support.</li>
          <li>The design worked better than expected, as, during the design process there were multiple breaks in the bridge that we had to repair. One of these end breaks even resulted in the end to be curved up instead of straight. We expected it to snap in the middle, where one of the breaks was, but our repair job and the flexibility of the middle of the bridge made it survive much longer.</li>
          <li>The bridge snapped at the ends both times. I estimated the point of failure to be where the bridge broke during the design process on the ends of the bridge.</li>
          <li>A little less glue on the ends of the bridge could allow for more flexibility. This change could have potentially prolonged the snapping at the ends of the bridge. Also, if the design process had gone smoother so that there weren't breaks in the bridge it may have been, overall, stronger.</li>

        <p>01/10-01/12 - These couple of days we have been learning about Chemical Engineering. We went over the many, many possible fields of Chemical Engineering. Unfortunately, we are fairly limited in projects that would be safe and that we would have enough materials for. So, we made oobleck. Oobleck is a non-newtonian fluid. It can be either solid or liquid, depending on how much pressure is applied. It can be made of cornstarch and water. However, we were not told the ratio we would have to use in order to properly make the substance. So, we assumed there would be more cornstarch than water, so we added water little by little to a few scoops of cornstarch until we got the right consistency. There are images and videos below. </p>

        <p>After taking our chemical engineering quiz, we have moved onto our long term projects. For this project, we had to choose between a car propelled by a mousetrap and an arduino car. We decided to go with the arduino car since we as a group have a decent amount of coding experience so we thought it would be fun to do. First, we had to do a project proposal in which we described our project, explained the research we had conducted, figured out the constraints of our design, made a BOM, and made a schedule for our milestones. Then we measured, sketched, and CADed our design. We also made an online circuit to experiment in how we would make our connections. Pictures are below. For the sketch, one box represents 1 cm.</p>

        <p> Recently, we've been continuing to work on one of our bigger projects. We were able to almost completely build our design and have been mostly working on the code. The base of our code was correct, but we kept messing up which pins were which so we struggled to even get the car to go forward. After asking our teacher for help, he explained the pinouts for the motor driver and was able to help us switch around the pins on the arduino so the code would work. So, we were sucessfully able to make the car drive forwards and backwards relatively straight. So, we started working on trying to get the car to turn. However, since our front wheels were connected the car would still continue going forwards when we tried to make it turn. So, we cut the axel of the wheel in half and put hot glue on the end so it wouldn't slip out. However, the hot glue provided too much friction. As a result, the wheels now did not move. So, we removed the wheels from the car so it was dragging. We started on a new design for the wheels and progressed further with the code. Catherine was able to put lights in the back that turned on when the car backed up. One of our other goals is to make front lights that are turn signals. We have a new design for the wheels, but they may be too thin to support the weight of the car. We have yet to test it, but we will at our next class meeting.</p>

        <p> 02-28-24 We just finished our arduino car. Yay! Our new design for our wheels originally worked, but grew weaker and eventually failed. There turned out to be too much friction, so they didn't turn all the time. So, we went back to our second design for the wheels, which included a circle of cardboard with a skewer hot glued in the middle. This skewer was then put through a straw and a dollop of hot glue was put on the other end of the skewer to prevent it from making it's way out from the inside of the straw. We had two of the wheels, in which each straw was taped to the bottom of each side of the cardboard. These wheels turned relatively well, and we did not have much time left so we stopped there. We were already finished with the code (including code for a distance sensor we ended up not using since we didn't end up getting one of the sensors since we were limited on supplies). The car was programmed to go straight, then back up while the back lights turned on, then turn left while the front left and back left LEDs blinked (like a turn signal), and finally turn right while the right front and right back LEDs blinked (like a turn signal). This code worked well, no problems to be reported. However, all of a sudden, on the day we were supposed to do the final test for our car in front of the whole class everything stopped working. The motors wouldn't even turn, so it didn't even go forward (the one requirement). However, when the arduino was plugged into the computer the LEDs were able to go through their "sequence" but the motors still didn't turn. We thought something might be wrong with the battery, so we replaced it with a completely new (wrapped in plastic) battery. However, still nothing happened. So, we assumed somehow the motors for the wheels had died. We were devestated. We had to, eventually, go to the cafeteria with everyone else while they did their final tests and we troubleshooted. I fiddled with it a lot, replacing some funky looking wires, turning the wheels manually, ect. But NOTHING worked. We were so dissapointed and couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. The next day our class met, we had our teacher look at our car to se if he could figure it out. He examined it for awhile and we determined there probably wasn't enough power for the motors and the LEDs to run. Our teacher switched a wire on the arduino that was in the wrong place. We thought that might fix it, but now the code was restarting in the middle of it. But, eventually we were able to get it to work properly. We finally filmed our car running today. It went okay, but the cardboard wheels must have been taped on crooked because the car didn't really go that straight. But, the LED's all worked and the motors still did what they were supposed to do. This project was very fiddly and annoying at times, but it was an interesting learning experience. I was able to experience first hand just how much troubleshooting there can be with a design and how important it is to test each iteration. I got to revisit our electrical section and was able to remember a lot of what we learned about circuits and coding LEDs.</p>

        <p> After finishing our Arduino Car, we got started on desinging for our new project. For this new project, we have to drop an egg from 3 stories. The goal is for it to not crack and "survive" the drop. So, we brainstormed and drew our design on paper along with the measurments. Then, we moved on to making our CAD version of the design. Pictures of both are attached below. On friday, we did a challenge before we started working on building for our egg drop. We had to hypothisize if there were more doors or wheels in CV. We went into the data collection with an open mind, as to not infect our data with a bias. Originally, we determined there were more wheels in CV. However, when listening to other groups present their data, we realized we had forgotton about locker doors! So, once we added those in, we determined that there were more door and presented our data to the class. Ultimately, our teacher decided our group had the best presentation so doors won! After completing this challenge, we had little time to work on our egg drop, so we were only able to cut out all 6 sides of the "box" our egg will be encased in.</p>

        <p> We finished our egg drop section on friday the 8th. We had about 30 minutes to finish up our designs. In this time, we decided to change the design of the outside paper on the box. We decided to put semi-oval pieces of paper on each of the six sides of the box. Then, we put small crumpled up balls of paper inside them. The purpose of this was to cushion the fall, as when the paper crumpled it would break the fall. Then, we added extra paper around to make sure the crumpled paper stayed inside. Then, we put the egg in the box with cotton balls surrounding it and taped the top of the box on. Finally, we tested it from the balcony of one of our buildings. The sound of ours hitting the ground was bad, but I think it was just the paper crumpling as the egg survived. It didn't even have a crack and was in "pristine" condition. Pictures and the video of the drop are below.</p>

        <p>We recently finished our new challenge, gutter boats. We had to make a boat that would fit in the dimension requirements of 7cm tall, 7cm wide and 14cm long. We were supposed to try and have the boat travel as far as possible. We could use any method for propulsion as long as we stayed within the allowed materials. Most groups decided to blow their boats (each team was allowed 4 breaths) including our group. We made a BOM (build of materials) and a CAD of our design. We wanted to be as much surface area as possible on the bottom of the boat, as that would help it to float. So, we used popsicle sticks on the bottom of the boat and put all the duct tape we had left over (after attaching everything else) inbetween to add more surface area. We had a paper sail and put "bumpers" of straw at the front of the boat to try and keep the sail from getting wet. Our boat ended up travelling 120 cm. This challenge was in preparation for our next project. Pictures are attached below. </p>

        <p> Before we did our final project we did another challenge. For this challenge, we had to make a contraption that would hold a water balloon at the end of a yard stick. We had to hold the other end of the yard stick and run with it. We raced on the track in multiple groups and the goal was to reach the finish line fastest without the water balloon breaking. We were given a limited amount of posicle sticks and unlimited rubber bands to use. We used the rubber bands to tie the popsicle sticks together. We ended up getting the fastest time in our "heat" and our water balloon was safe and secure. There are a few pictures of our design below. After this challenge, we started on our final project. We have to make a boat out of one roll of duct tape and cardboard that would hold two of our team members down the length of the pool and back. So far, we have made all but three pieces of cardboard for our boat and we have started to tape some of the sides to the base. We watched a few videos about buoyancy to try and uderstand how to make our boat float with the weight of two people. So, we tried to make there be enough surface area so that it would float without having to much area to cover since we have limited tape. We decided to make our base a rectangle with a triangle at each end. Also, we plan to cover the entire bottom of the boat with duct tape to try and keep the cardboard from absorbing too much water. Additionally, we are going to put dividers inbetween the sections each person will be sitting in to try and keep water from going to all the other parts of the boat if it happens to leak into one. The triangle at the each end of the boat aims to cut through the water faster so the boat is in the water for less time and has less of a chance from sinking. The rectangle part gives it more surface area so it has more buoyancy. Progress pictures are put below.</p>

        <p>During the building process, we realized that the compartments in our boat were too short, and the passengers could not fit. So we decided to add 5 inches to the triangles to extend the compartments. Through this modification, we learned to double check our measurements. Some of our team members think the boat will succeed, others do not. It does seem fairly sturdy and we think it is taped well enough for it to keep water out for at least one length of the pool. The dividers give some peace of mind, as if one part of the duct tape is less sturdy it will not affect the rest of the boat. We could have possibly used our tape more efficiently and put extra time into making sure it does not wrinkle and was more tidy. I think the most difficult part will be getting into the boat and making sure we do not tip it when getting in. That will also be the first test of if it actually floats with our body weights in it. We are going to test on wednesday the 29th.</p>
